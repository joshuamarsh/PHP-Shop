# E-Commerce Website

## Description

This is a php e-commerce website that would communicate to a C# windows form in order for customers to click and collect their items to the store so that the shop could view the orders and process them. This was my first php full project so there are alot of bugs such as making my sql queries parameterized to prevent sql injection attacks and also since making this I have improved alot in my CSS and HTML skills so alot of what I did was impractical and it should be made responsive.
